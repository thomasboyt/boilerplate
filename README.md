this is just some react+redux+react-router boilerplate for personal projects

### Install

You're probably going to want `node@4.x` and `npm@3.x`.

Then:

```
npm install
```

### Run

```
npm run-script dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:8080/`.

### Test

```
npm run-script karma
```

Will run tests in Chrome.
